# licence-plate-recognition
Detecting licence plates using OpenALPR Library, and checking with our database whether the Licence Plate gets a match in our database or not.
If it is present in the Database, the plate is not fraudulent, otherwise the licence plate is fraudulent and it creates an alert.

This repository is still a work in progress right now
